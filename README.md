# Paint-app
I created a simple painting app using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. The app allows users to draw freely on a canvas with mouse movements, choose brush colors, and adjust brush sizes. It provides a basic yet interactive experience for digital drawing and showcases the use of GUI programming in Python.
